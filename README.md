## 📖 Project Overview
The video game market is saturated, with thousands of games released annually. This project investigates the connection between economic behavior (price, ownership), user engagement (playtime, reviews), and game content (tags).

**Key Goals**
1.  **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualize the distribution of prices, ownership, and review scores.
2.  **Clustering:** Use Unsupervised Learning (K-Means) to segment the market into distinct performance tiers.

**Key Findings**
* **Retention drives Scale:** Long-term engagement is the strongest predictor of commercial value.
* **Two Paths to Success:** We identified a "Viral Hit" formula (Action-heavy, high mechanics) and a "Premium" formula (Narrative-heavy, high price justification).
* **Review Decoupling:** High review scores are common across all price points and do not strongly correlate with market size.
